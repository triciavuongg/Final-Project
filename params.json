I have found a dataset that represents the percentile of obese adults represented in each U.S. state. I've gathered the data set and created a geospatial map that visually represents the information. The map is a visual representation of the data set and can help users draw conclusions to the obesity problem. I will also attach links that lead to other visual datasets showing the relationship to obesity and ethnicity. It also draws upon a larger picture how location and socio-economic status can be a direct effect in to food and nutrition. \r\n\r\n##Interactive:\r\n\r\n# Self-Reported Obesity Among U.S. Adults, 2014\r\n\r\n##About the Project:\r\n\r\nObesity is a commonly talked about subject and especially present in America.

It \r\n\r\nThe data set was taken form the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The site explicitly mentions that no state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20% and five states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20%-25%. Three states including Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia had obesity rates greater than 35%. In general, the Midwest had the highest prevalence of obesity with an average of 30% followed by the South, Northeast, and then the West. \r\n\r\nI made the visualization based off the data set percentile. I used colors to represent the different range in information. For states that received 20-25% obesity rates were colored green. States that were 25-30% yellow, 30-35% orange, and states greater than 35% were marked red. I manually logged in the data set and polygon sizes for each state and created the visualization using the geospatial data and [Mapbox.](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/triciavuongg.cigv5gq2b0i1l4pm3l465rmuw/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidHJpY2lhdnVvbmdnIiwiYSI6ImNpZ3Y1Z3JlNjBpb2Z4MW0weGdlZXJnNXkifQ.b7KKZAsS481brstkAIl7tg#4/40.74/-74.00)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
