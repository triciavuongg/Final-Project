{"name":"Self-Reported Obesity Among U.S. Adults, 2014","tagline":"","body":"#Self-Reported Obesity Among U.S. Adults, 2014\r\n\r\n##About the Project:\r\n\r\nObesity is a commonly talked about subject and especially present in America. I have found a dataset that represents the percentile of obese adults represented in each U.S. state. I've gathered the data set and created a geospatial map that visually represents the information. The map is a visual representation of the data set and can help users draw conclusions to the obesity problem. I will also attach links that lead to other visual datasets showing the relationship to obesity and ethnicity. It also draws upon a larger picture how location and socio-economic status can be a direct effect in to food and nutrition. \r\n\r\n##Interactive:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" frameBorder=\"0\" src=\"https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/triciavuongg.cigv5gq2b0i1l4pm3l465rmuw.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidHJpY2lhdnVvbmdnIiwiYSI6ImNpZ3Y1Z3JlNjBpb2Z4MW0weGdlZXJnNXkifQ.b7KKZAsS481brstkAIl7tg\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n##Project Procedure:\r\n\r\nThe [data set](http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html) was taken form the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The site explicitly mentions that no state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20% and five states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20%-25%. Three states including Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia had obesity rates greater than 35%. In general, the Midwest had the highest prevalence of obesity with an average of 30% followed by the South, Northeast, and then the West. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
