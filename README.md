# Self-Reported Obesity Among U.S. Adults, 2014

##About the Project:

Obesity is a commonly talked about subject and especially present in America. I have found a dataset that represents the percentile of obese adults represented in each U.S. state. I've gathered the data set and created a geospatial map that visually represents the information. The map is a visual representation of the data set and can help users draw conclusions to the obesity problem. I will also attach links that lead to other visual datasets showing the relationship to obesity and ethnicity. It also draws upon a larger picture how location and socio-economic status can be a direct effect in to food and nutrition.
