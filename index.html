<p>Obesity is a commonly talked about subject and especially present in America. I have found a dataset that represents the percentile of obese adults represented in each U.S. state. I've gathered the data set and created a geospatial map that visually represents the information. The map is a visual representation of the data set and can help users draw conclusions to the obesity problem. I will also attach links that lead to other visual datasets showing the relationship to obesity and ethnicity. It also draws upon a larger picture how location and socio-economic status can be a direct effect in to food and nutrition. </p>

<a id="project-procedure" class="anchor" href="#project-procedure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Procedure:</h1>

<p>This is the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/table-adults.html">data set</a> that I used for my project. </p>

<p>The data set was taken form the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html">CDC</a> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The site explicitly mentions that no state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20% and five states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20%-25%. Three states including Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia had obesity rates greater than 35%. In general, the Midwest had the highest prevalence of obesity with an average of 30% followed by the South, Northeast, and then the West. </p>

<p>I made the visualization based off the data set percentile. I used colors to represent the different range in information. For states that received 20-25% obesity rates were colored green. States that were 25-30% yellow, 30-35% orange, and states greater than 35% were marked red. I manually logged in the data set and polygon sizes for each state and created the visualization using the geospatial data and <a href="https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/triciavuongg.cigv5gq2b0i1l4pm3l465rmuw/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoidHJpY2lhdnVvbmdnIiwiYSI6ImNpZ3Y1Z3JlNjBpb2Z4MW0weGdlZXJnNXkifQ.b7KKZAsS481brstkAIl7tg#4/40.74/-74.00">Mapbox.</a></p>

<p>I decided to select a geospatial map for my visualization on this project because it was the best way to represent the data. The data set given gave me a percentile and a state. After logging this information in manually, it created an interactive map. Users can view the map and roll over each state to see exactly what percentile it receives. The users can also visually see the data according to the color that matches what range that state falls into. The CDC also had released other data sets relating obesity rates with ethnicity. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/table-non-hispanic.html">first</a> data set represents obesity rates amongst "Non-hispanics". You can see that most of the states that did fall greater than 35% do not appear in the data. The states with a lower percentile of obesity rates remain the same. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/table-non-hispanic-black.html">second</a> data set represents obesity among non-hispanic black adults. Here, the data is clearly evident that if you were look particularly at non-hispanic black individuals, the percentile of obesity would increase dramatically. This data set shows nearly all the states having a rate of 35% or higher obesity rates within this demographic frame. Lastly, the CDC has a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/table-hispanics.html">third</a> data set looking specifically at obesity among hispanic adults. The data here shows an influx in rates along the West coast and Southern borders. </p>

<p>The separate data sets show a relationship between obesity and ethnicity. Location plays a large part into understanding the area's demographics and this data represents a socio-economic imbalance that exists within state borders and especially among different ethnic groups. Increased numbers of obesity in these specific areas shows how it is a systemic struggle that these people face in order to receive a balanced and nutritious meal. </p>
