<p>Obesity is a commonly talked about subject and especially present in America. I have found a dataset that represents the percentile of obese adults represented in each U.S. state. I've gathered the data set and created a geospatial map that visually represents the information. The map is a visual representation of the data set and can help users draw conclusions to the obesity problem. I will also attach links that lead to other visual datasets showing the relationship to obesity and ethnicity. It also draws upon a larger picture how location and socio-economic status can be a direct effect in to food and nutrition. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html">data set</a> was taken form the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website. The site explicitly mentions that no state had a prevalence of obesity less than 20% and five states and the District of Columbia had a prevalence of obesity between 20%-25%. Three states including Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia had obesity rates greater than 35%. In general, the Midwest had the highest prevalence of obesity with an average of 30% followed by the South, Northeast, and then the West. </p>
